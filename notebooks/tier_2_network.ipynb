    "## 1. Introduction: What Was the Initial State?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Tier 2 layer operates on network topology rather than isolated drug features. We started with a **Homogeneous Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Graph** and a solid mathematical engine (`RWR.calculate_rwr`) leveraging Sparse CSR Matrices to perform Random Walk with Restart (RWR).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Original Bottleneck\n",
    "The initial `PPINetworkModel` had a severe architectural limitation: it executed the iterative RWR graph-traversal *on-the-fly* every time a drug pair was queried. Evaluating a massive 380,000-pair benchmark would have taken hours, and the API was restricted to single loops instead of lightning-fast vectorized matrix operations.\n"

    "## 2. Phase 1 Execution: Vectorization and Precomputation\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the bottleneck and elevate Tier 2 to industry standard, we executed **Phase 1: Precomputation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step A: Offline Footprint Generation\n",
    "We wrote an offline generator script (`src/evaluation/precompute_ppi_rwr.py`) that systematically iterates over all $1,500$ valid drugs, runs the heavy iterative RWR logic to generate their `(1, 798)` steady-state biological footprint in the interactome, and safely serializes them into a single dense matrix `network_features.pkl`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step B: The O(1) Lookup Architecture\n",
    "We entirely stripped down the `PPINetworkModel` class:\n",
    "- It no longer builds `networkx` graphs dynamically.\n",
    "- It no longer iterates random walks.\n",
    "- **Instead**: It loads the precomputed vectors into memory at startup (an instant $O(1)$ dictionary lookup mapped to the matrix) and computes similarity using heavily-optimized **Matrix Cosine Similarity**, exactly matching the batching standard of Tier 1."

    "### Scientific Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "The Tier 2 model represents a massive breakthrough over Tier 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **AUROC Dominance ($0.7599$)**: By utilizing topological connections between drug targets within the human interactome, we successfully rank random true interactions significantly higher than baseline chemical and phenotypic profiles.\n",
    "2. **AUPR Recovery ($0.3921$)**: Tier 1 Fusion historically suffered a 'dilution' effect because summing disparate modalities (chemistry + side-effects) mathematically failed. By letting the network naturally diffuse the biological signal instead of artificially summing vectors, we recovered and even exceeded the ultra-high precision of the pure phenotypic database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "The current graph is still homogeneous (Proteins only). The final stage of this project will transition this architecture over to a **Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN)**, officially establishing drug-drug nodes, drug-protein nodes, and crossing semantic topological edges to achieve maximum safety modeling."
