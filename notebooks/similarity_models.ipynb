    "### Decision 1: Base Class Pattern (DRY)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Tanimoto and Jaccard are the same formula. Writing it twice violates DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** `BinarySimilarityEngine` owns one implementation. `TanimotoEngine` and `JaccardEngine` are named subclasses — they add semantic clarity without duplicating logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision 2: Data Extraction stays in the Orchestrator\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Should `binary_similarity.py` parse SMILES strings and generate fingerprints itself?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** No. `binary_similarity.py` only accepts plain numpy arrays. RDKit parsing, fingerprint generation, and caching all live in `AdvancedFusionModel`. This keeps the math engine pure and reusable for non-chemistry data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:** If you use `TanimotoEngine` for a different domain (genetic sequences, user preference vectors), it works out of the box — no chemistry library dependency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision 3: O(1) Phenotypic Lookup Map\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Accessing rows from a Pandas DataFrame by drug ID (`df.loc[id]`) is `O(log n)` per lookup — acceptable for a few drugs, slow for thousands.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** At `__init__` time, extract the DataFrame index into a Python dict:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "self.pheno_idx_map = {drug_id: idx for idx, drug_id in enumerate(df_pheno.index)}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Dict lookup is `O(1)`. The matrix becomes a CSR sparse structure indexed by integer position.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision 4: Vectorized API\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Calling `predict_fusion_score()` for each drug pair one at a time requires a Python `for` loop over 500 pairs — bypassing all the numpy/CSR speed benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** All methods accept **lists of drugs** and process them in one batched matrix call. The grid search runs 500 pairs in a single vectorized operation."

    "2. **The Fusion Ceiling**: The `AdvancedFusionModel` attempts to bridge these domains using a simple linear weighted sum. However, this naive approach fails to create synergy. The fused model achieves an AUROC of $0.6194$ (a slight improvement in global ranking), but its AUPR ($0.1445$) collapses compared to using the phenotypic data alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why does Linear Fusion fail here?\n",
    "A linear sum assumes that a unit of \"chemical similarity\" is directly interchangeable with a unit of \"side-effect similarity\". Biologically, this is false. A drug's 2D chemical structure and its systemic human side-effects exist across vastly different dimensional scales. \n",
    "\n",

    "The Tier 2 PPI network absolutely shatters the Tier 1 baseline.\n",

    "- **AUROC Leap**: It jumps from $0.6194$ (Tier 1 Fused) up to **$0.7599$**. This proves that tracking the structural paths between protein targets in the interactome handles global drug ranking vastly better than chemical or phenotypic overlap.\n",
    "- **Precision Recovery**: It achieves an AUPR of $0.3921$, reclaiming and ultimately exceeding the ultra-high precision that the Tier 1 Phenotypic model exhibited ($0.3691$), without suffering from the \"Fusion Ceiling\" dilution.\n",

    "The graph topology naturally bridges the biological domain. However, we are currently only using Protein-to-Protein edges. The final evolutionary step is introducing the Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN)."
